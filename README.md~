Craigslist Screen Scraper for Rails/Front-End Job Searching  

This is a screen scraper that collects applications for telecommuting programmer jobs related to anything Rails or AngularJS.  


TODO  
1) Fix the crawler system to grab the correct date. It is currently based on UTC time and is broken.  
2) When no crawlers are returned, a page should returning saying that no results were found.
